          US President Donald Trump has mild symptoms of Covid-19 after he and
          his wife Melania tested positive for the coronavirus, the White House
          says.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Mr Trump's chief of staff said the president was "on the job" and "in
          good spirits", but his physician also said he was "fatigued".
        </p>
        <p>
          The news comes just over a month before presidential elections, where
          he will face Democratic challenger Joe Biden.
        </p>

          on Friday.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I hope this serves as a reminder," he tweeted after the result. "Wear
          a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands."
        </p>
        <p>
          The pair stood on stage together just days ago for a presidential
          debate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr Biden's staff said he would travel to Michigan on Friday as planned
          for several campaign events. He and his wife have wished the
          presidential couple a speedy recovery.

          Officials said the process of tracking all the president's contacts in
          recent days was ongoing, adding that Mr Trump was considering how he
          might address the nation or otherwise communicate with the American
          people on Friday.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he pulled out of a video conference call with vulnerable seniors
          scheduled for Friday, leaving Vice-President Mike Pence to chair the
          meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Thursday, the first couple said they intended to self-isolate after
          one of Mr Trump's closest aides, Hope Hicks, tested positive. Soon
          afterwards, they too received positive test results.
        </p>
        <p>
          There has been criticism of Mr Trump's decision to go to a fundraiser
          attended by dozens of people in New Jersey on Thursday, apparently
          when officials already knew about Ms Hicks's symptoms.

        <p>
          Ms Hicks, 31, travelled with Mr Trump on Air Force One to the first
          presidential TV debate with Mr Biden in Ohio on Tuesday. Some of Mr
          Trump's family members who attended the debate were seen not wearing
          masks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr Trump has mostly spurned mask-wearing and has often been pictured
          not socially distanced with aides or others during official
          engagements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coronavirus has infected more than 7.2 million Americans, killing
          more than 200,000 of them.

        <h2>What do we know about Trump's condition?</h2>
        <p>
          White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Mr Trump was experiencing
          mild symptoms and he was optimistic the president would make a speedy
          recovery.
        </p>
        <p>He was on the job and would remain on the job, Mr Meadows added.</p>
        <p>
          Mr Trump's physician Sean Conley said in a statement that the
          president had "as a precautionary measure received an 8g dose of
          Regeneron's polyclonal antibody cocktail", which is administered to
          help reduce virus levels and speed recovery.

          He was also taking zinc, vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and aspirin,
          Dr Conley said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "As of this afternoon he remains fatigued but in good spirits," he
          added. The first lady was "well with only a mild cough and headache".
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier Mr Trump wrote on Twitter: "We will get through this
          together."

              Mr Trump's physician, Dr Sean Conley, released a statement late on
              Thursday,

          </a>
          saying the president and the first lady were "both well at this time,
          and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their
          convalescence".
        </p>
        <p>
          White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany - who spoke to reporters
          outside on Friday afternoon, but without a mask - said she "had no
          knowledge of Hope Hicks' positive test" before her previous briefing.
        </p>
        <p>
          She added that White House officials had deemed it safe for Mr Trump
          to go to New Jersey, despite the news.

        <hr />
        <p>
          According to Mr Trump's most recent physical examination earlier this
          year, he weighed 244lbs (110.7kg). This is considered to be obese for
          his height of 6ft 3ins.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Dr Conley stated at the time that the president "remains healthy".
          Mr Trump will also have the best medical care available.
        </p>
        <p>
          America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says a
          person must self-isolate for 10 days after a positive test.

          It is not clear how Mr Trump's positive test will affect arrangements
          for the second presidential debate, which is scheduled for 15 October
          in Miami, Florida.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Trump campaign issued a statement saying Mr Trump's campaign
          events would be temporarily postponed or turned virtual, but Mr Pence
          will continue campaigning as he tested negative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr Trump is not the first world leader to have tested positive.
          Earlier this year, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazil's
          President Jair Bolsonaro were infected. They both have since
          recovered, although Mr Johnson had to receive regular oxygen treatment
          to help his breathing during hospitalisation.

          So far, the vast majority of released test results have been negative.
          No-one can be sure who caught the virus first among these leading US
          political figures and their relatives, or who passed it to whom, or
          where they caught it.
